          <h3 class="text-center">Here's a time line of Zach LaVine's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1995</strong> - LaVine was born in Renton, Washington, to athletic parents.</li>
            <li><strong>2012</strong> - LaVine verbally committed to attending UCLA and playing for coach Ben Howland for the 2013 season.</li>
            <li><strong>2013</strong> - After a strong start to 2013–14 as the team's sixth man, featuring an impressive display of outside shooting and explosive dunks, the former point guard LaVine evoked memories of former Bruin Russell Westbrook's UCLA
              beginnings.
            </li>
            <li><strong>2014</strong> - He endured a shooting slump where he made just 7 of 36 shots from the field. He averaged 9.4 points per game made were the second most by a freshman in the school's history.</li>
            <li><strong>2014</strong> - LaVine was selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the 13th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft and signed his rookie scale contract on July 8, 2014.</li>
            <li><strong>2015</strong> - the Timberwolves exercised their third-year team option on LaVine's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2016–17 season.</li>
            <li><strong>2016</strong> - LaVine scored 30 points for Team USA in the Rising Stars Challenge to capture MVP honors. He also became the fourth player ever to win consecutive Slam Dunk Contests.</li>
          </ul>
